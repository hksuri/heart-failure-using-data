Exploring Heart Failure with Data

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more people die annually from Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) than any other causes. In 2016, almost a third of all deaths were attributed to CVDs. The risk of cardiovascular disease substantially increases due to the presence of hypertension, diabetes or other established diseases. However, cardiovascular diseases can be sufficiently mitigated by addressing behavioural risk patterns such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity.

Therefore, a system that can identify at-risk populations more accurately can be a great boon to society. Using a dataset from the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan) available on Kaggle, we attempt to develop a model that can be used to predict heart failure and in doing so identify at-risks populations. We began our study by asking: **Can we predict heart failure based on blood quality data?** In doing this we wanted to understand:
- What population groups are at a greater risk of heart failure?
- To what extent does smoking as a lifestyle and diabetes as a chronic health condition bias heart failure?
